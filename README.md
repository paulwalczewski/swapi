I've ussed React because scales really nicely and is suitable for this kind of tiny projects just like it is suitable for large ones. Also used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to quickly set up necessary boilerplate (basic webpack config with dev server, transpiling, etc).

How to run it:
1. clone this repo, cd to project directory
2. npm i
3. npm start
